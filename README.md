# LionMinestom
A basic minestom project designed to have a lightweight lobby integrated in LionAPI
> <strong>The features provided should be similar to SimpleLobby. Look [here](https://github.com/LionCraft08/SimpleLobby) for more information.</strong>

# Setup
Download the jar and execute it once to create the config file. Now, complete the configuration. If you have questions regarding the TCP connection to [LionVelocity](https://github.com/LionCraft08/LionVelocity), look at the config.yml file of [LionAPI](https://github.com/LionCraft08/LionAPI).<br>
To complete the configuration, add the TCP connection details and the velocity forwarding secret to the config.json.
# Features 
- The Minestom server has a really basic world generator built-in and currently doesn't support custom worlds. However, it is planned to add a world loader soon.<br>
- The server will automatically request the available backend servers and create an inventory to allow players selecting one to connect to. For a more detailed description and a better overview, make sure to create the json files in plugins/lionvelocity/servericons/. 
- It has double jump:)
